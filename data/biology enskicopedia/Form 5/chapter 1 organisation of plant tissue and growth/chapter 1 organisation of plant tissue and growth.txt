Plant tissue = meristematic tissue : apicam meristematic, lateral meristematic ; permanent tissue : epidermal tissue, vascular tissue, ground tissue
Meristematic tissue = actively dividing tissue through mitosis ; consist of small cells with thin walls, large nuclei, dense cytoplasm and no vacuoles ; not undergone diffrentiation
Permanent tissue = mature tissue ; have undergone differentiation or still undergoing differentiation
Meristematic tissue = apicam meristematic, lateral meristematic
Permanent tissue = epidermal tissue, vascular tissue, ground tissue
Epidermal tissue = cover the outermost surface of stems, leaves, and roots of young plants protecting underlying tissues ; epidermal cells which are exposed to air have a waxy and waterproof layer[cuticle]
Cuticle = waxy and waterproff layer ; reduce loss of water through evaporation (transpiration) ; protects leaf from mechanical injuries and pathogens
Modified epidermal cells = guard cells, root hair cells
Guard cells = control the opening of stoma
Root hair cells = increase the surface area of root for the absorbtion of mineral salts
Parenchyma tissue = simplest living cell ; do not undergo differentiation ; involved in photosynthesis ; store sugar, starch, gaseous exchange ; give support and shape to herbaceous plants ; thinnest cell walls ; always in turgid state to provide support and maintaining shape of herbaceous plant ; involved in the repair and regeneration of plant tissues as well as in the vascular system
Collenchyma tissue = living cells which mature into flexible cells ; made of pectin and hemicellulose ; cell wall thicker than parenchyma tissues ; provide mechanical support and elasticity to plant ; support non-woody plants, young stem and petioles
Schlerenchyma tissue = more ridgid than collenchyma tissue ; cell wall made by lignin ; thickest among 3 ground tissues ; most cell are dead at maturity ; give support and mechanical strength to mature region of plants ; help in transport of water and nutrients
Xylem = give support ; mainly transport water and mineral ions ; from root to upper part of plant ; gainst gravitational pull
Phloem = trnasport organic food substances synthesised by leaves during photosynthesis ; to other parts of plant
Xylem and phloem = do not involve in trnasportation of oxygen and carbon dioxide ; movement of gases is by diffusion
Xylem tissue = cell wall are thickened with lignin : prevents food substances from entering the cells ; xylem tissues dies upon maturity : When the cytoplasm disintegrates, a hollow tube is left behind ; consist of xylem vessels : elongated, hollow and continuous connected to each other from roots to leaves
Phloem tissue = consist of parenchyma cells, sclereids, sieve tube, companion cells ; made of living cells[seive tube] with the presence of cytoplasm ; seive tube : no organelles such as nucleus and ribosome as they are decomposed at maturity stage ; consist of seive tube arranged end to end forming elongated continuous tbe structures ; transport sugar produced via photosynthesis form leaves to storage organs (roots, fruits, tubers)
seive tube = no organelles such as nucleus and ribosome as they are decomposed at maturity stage
Meristematic tissues = actively dividing through mitosis ; differentiating to form specialised cells ; consist small cells with thin walls, large nuclei, dense cytoplasm, no / small vacuole ; not undergone differentiation
Apical meristems = located at tip of roots and buds of shoots ; undergo mitotic cell division to increase number of cells for plant growth
Lateral meristem / cambia = found in peropheral areas of stems and roots ; responsible for secondary growth : add girth to plant
growht and development = changes in organisms which starts from zygote stage to adult
growth = irreversible process : results in increase in size, body mass, number of cell ; quantitative change : increase in solid matter, dry mass and the amount in cytoplasm
Development = change in shape, function, and degree of complexity that accompany growth ; involves qualitative changes associated with differentiation and specialisation : process where unspecialised structures are modified to perform a specific function
Cell division stage = take place at apical meristems contains meristematic cells which divide actively by mitosis ; number of cell in organism increase by mitosis ; geometric progression ; increase of cell number caused elongation of plant stem
Cell elongation stage = size and volume of cells in organism increase through the intake of water and other necessary substances from environment ; into the cell store inside vacuoles ; vacuolation occurs
Vacuolation = small vacuoles fuse to form large vacuole ; diffused water exert pressure against cell wall which pushes, elongates, widens cell
Cell differentiation stage = consist differenciationg cells : differentiate once reached maximun size ; to form permanent tissues : epidermis, cortex, xylem, phloem ; cell change shape and structure to become specialised cells with specific function
Primary growth = occurs after germination ; take place in all plants to elongate their stem and root ; take place at shoot tip and root tip
{P} at shoot tips = leaf primordia ans shoot primordia will grow to form new leaves and shoots ; enables plant to increase in height
{P} at root tip = root cap will become exhausted when they penentrate the soil ; cause cells of root cap to be replaced by meristematic cells
Secondary growth = occurs mainly in eudicots(dicots)[small numbers of monocots too] ; for non-woody plants such as herbaceous, secondary growth does not occurs ; reuslts from the division of lateral meristem cells located in stem and root ; to increase the circumference or diameter of plant stem and root;
Secondary growth at root = vascular - divides actively - combine - form complete ring ; cells in cambium ring divides inwards form secondary xylem, outwards - secondary phloem ; due to - vascular cambium activity - root - thicker ; cork cambium - under epidermis divides - form cock cells - provide protection to root tissue
Light-colored rings = wood grew in spring and early summer
Dark-colored rings = wood that grew in late summer and fall
Necessity of primary growth = allow maximum elongation of plant to absorb sunlight for photosynthesis ; primary phloem transport products of photosynthesis form leaves to other parts of plant ; primary xylem transport water and mineral salts from soil via roots to leaves, provide support
Necessity of secondary growth = provide stability to plants by increasing stem and root diameter to suit height of plant ; provides mechanical support to plants ; produce more xylem and phloem tissue ; produce xylem and phloem tissue continuously to replace old and damaged ; produce stronger and thicker bark to provide protection to plant form excessive water loss, physical injuries and pathogen infection ; able to live longer by increasing chance of seed production and reproduction
Economic importance of plants that have undergone secondary growth = have high economic values : produce timber ; have strong and hard woods : suitable to be used as structures for houseboats, fences, doors and other ; presence of annual ring : make furnitures look attractive, can be made as decorative item ; woods and barks of some plant : can produce resin and oil which can be commercialised as varnish, adhesive substances, perfume and medicine ; flowering plants : decorative plants ; commercialised fruits : product of plant that have undergone secondary growth, able to generate income / economic growth
Plants grow curve = classified based on life cycles : ; annual plants ; biennial plants ; perennial plants
Annual plants = plants that have only 1 life cycle for a season or a year ; usually die after completing their biological cycle[from germination to end with flowering or producing seeds] ; exp : paddy, pumpkin, watermelon
Biennial plant = plants which take 2 years with 2 seasons of growth to complete their life cycle ; first growth : vegetative growth which is the growth of roots, leaves, stem structures ; second growth : reproduction ; most biennial plants grow in temperate regions ; after going through vagetative growth, these plants briefly stop growth process during winter ; growth continues as preparation for reproduction by flowering ; plant produce fruit and seed and will eventually die ; exp : cabbage, carrot, silver cock's comb
Perennial plant = plants live more than 2 years ; have longer lifespan depending on species and condition ; classifies into : woody perennial plants and herbaceous perennial plants ; most are able to flower and bear friuts many times throughout life ; have structures that are adaptable to surroundings and temperature change exp : grass, hibiscus plant, mango plant
Annual plant growth curve = sigmoid curve
Biennial plant growth curve = two sigmoid curve
Perennial plant growth curve = a series of small sigmoid curves
