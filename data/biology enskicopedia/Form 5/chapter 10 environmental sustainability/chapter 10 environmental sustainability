Biological control agent = technology based on ecological concepts that control pest attack on highland vegetables (exp: cabbages, lettuces and tomatoes) ; biological control agent: Diadegma semiclausum(parasitic wasp), Cotesia vestalis(parasitic wasp), Coenosia exigua(tiger fly) ; introduced by MARDI and Department of Agriculture to safeguard food security and quality and reduce environmental pollution ; not only safe for consumers but benificial towards conserving the stability of the ecosystem
Environmental sustainability = environmental condition that remains the same without any reduction or depletion of natural resources, with an assured quality of the surrounding environment, for a long period of time
Climate change = change in temperature of earth, rainfall distribution, drastic changes of the wind ; can be seen as a result of the greenhouse effect phonomenon
Deforestation = action of clearing a wide area of trees in a large scale ; main cause for the loss of biodiversity ; loss of habitat of animals caused extinction of many species of flora and fauna
Eutrophication = process that occurs when water ecosystem becomes rich with nutrients, resulting in changes to the structure of the ecosystem  ; excessive usage of nitrate and phosphate fertilizers in agriculture is a fator causing eutrophication ; effect: algae blooms, death of aquatic life and deterioration of water quality
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) = total amount of oxygen needed by microorganisms to decompose organic materials in water ; high BOD >> water source low quality[many organic substances and decomposed microorganisms in water] ; low BOD >> water source high quality[unpolluted and dissolves oxygen content is high] ; measured by the time to decolourise 0.1% methylene blue solution (faster >> BOD higher)
Air pollution = happens when there is an increase in the pollutant substances such as gases, smoke, dust, particles in atmosphere which affect health and lives of ...
Burning of fossil fuel releases = carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide ; combine with water vapour in atmosphere to form nitric acid and sulphuric acids
Thermal pollution = the deteriotion of water quality due to excessive heat dissipation into water caused by processes that change the water temperature ; water is cooling agent to cool down generator in factories / hydroelectric power
Noise pollution = define as sounds that disturb and cause detrimental effects to health ; exposure to high level of noice for prolonged period >> high b;lood pressure, depression, headache
Population growth explosion = increase in total number of humans living in a cetrain area ; rapid population growth, rapid reduction of natural resources
Ecosystem preservation = efforts made to protect the components of an ecosystem so it remains in its natural condition
Reserved forests = forest protected form any development activities
Ecosystem conservation = effort to restore / healing enviromental resources that are used without causing them to extinct ; exp: water, forest, air, minerals ; two strategies: In situ conservation, Ex situ conservation
In situ conservation = conservation that retains wildlife species in their original habitat ; exp: natural parks, marine parks
Ex situ conservation = conservation that keeps wildlife species outside their original habitat ; exp: zoos, botanical parks
Ecosystem restoration = efforts for renewing and restoring natural ecosystems that have deteriorated, damaged, destroyed due to human activities ; exp: reforestation
5R concept = 5R's concept ; Rethink, Repair, Reuse, Reduce, Recycle
Upcycling waste substances = turning old substances into new, beautiful, creative things
Biological control = way to control the polulation of pests using their natural enemies ; way to reduce usage of pesticides
Food security = defined as having an assurance on the avialability of food, as wel as sufficient access to food and safe food utilisation ; Components: Avialability of food, Access of food, food utilisation/food usage, food stability
Availability of food = there is suficient supply of high quality food in the local market as well as for imported food
Access of food = Food can be obtained easily in order to meet the nutritional needs of diet
Food utilisation = ability of an individual to get enough nutrients by consuming food and drinking clean water as well as good practices in food procesing and preparation
Food stability = Each individual has access to get enough nutritious food at all times
Halal = determining status of food security ; means inclusive in all aspects, from farm to final product
Green technology = developemnt of technologiea and applications of products, equipment and systems to preserve the environmemt and nature ; practice ij the community towards sustaining the environment in order to lead a better lifestyle
National green technology polocy = gives emphasis on the growth of economy and sustainable development of the country ; based on 4 pillars: social, energy, economy, environment
Social science = made use of scientific methods to investigate the field of humanity
