Leaves = main organ of plant ; carries out photosynthesis
External structure = Lamina, petiole
Lamina = flat, thin, smooth and green part of the leaf ; flat-shaped to provide wide surface to expose cells containing chloroplast to the max amount sunlight ; thin to allow gases involved in photosynthesis to diffuse efficiently in the leaf
Petiole = leaf stalk that connects lamina to the stem of plant ; stretches out into the lamina producing network of middle veins to support lamina
Leaf mosaic = in most plants, leaves grow without overlapping to enable then receive optimum light - photosynthesis
Cuticle = waxy, waterproof, transparent layer cover upper / lower parts of leaf epidermis ; reduce excessive loss of water through evaporation(transpiration) ; transparent cuticle allows sunlight to pass through
Upper epidermis = upper surface of leaf under cuticle layer ; does not contain any chloroplast ; transparent so light can pass through it
Lower epidermis = lower surface of the leaf ; consists of stomata : each stoma guarded by a pair of guard cells
Palisade mesophyll = arranged vertically and closed-packed to recceive max light exposure ; theese cells are sites for photosynthesis : contain many chloroplast
Spongy mesophyll = irregular-shaped : increases the internal surface area for gaseous exchange ; loosely arranged : many intercellular air spaces ; ease carbon dioxide and water absorbtion through leaves to palisade mesophyll cells during photosynthesis ; has less number of chloroplasts than palisade mesophyll
Vascular bundle = xylem : ; transport water and mineral salts from root to leaf ; wall of xylem lignified, thickened to provide mechanical support and strength to plants ; phloen : ; transports organic substances produced during photosynthesis from leaves to other parts of plants
Necessity of gaseous exchange in plants = Stomata : pores located at lower epidermis of leaf ; each stomata guarded by pair of guard cell : control opening and closing of stoma by changing shape ; guard cell contains chloroplast : carry out photosynthesis
Cacti plant = open stoma only during night only for carbon dioxide exchange : colder temp of night can reduce water loss
Mechanism of stomata opening and closing = depends : potassium ion (K+) uptake, sucrose concentration in guard cell sap
{P} uptake of potassium ions by guard cell = accumulation or elimation of potassium ion : change solute potential ; increase / decrease water potential in guard cell ; water diffuse out or into guard cell via osmosis ; this condition determines whether guard cells are turgid or flaccid ; stoma opening : K+ ions enters vacuole, water follows by osmosis, guard cells become turgid and curve outwords ; stoma closing : K+ ions exits vacuoles, water follows by osmosis, stoma closes as guard cell lose turgidity and become flaccid
{P} sucrose concentration in guard cell sap = day time : presence of light ; photosynthesis take place produces dissolved sugar (sucrose) ; concentration of sucrose in guard cells become high ; water potential in guard cell decreases ; water molecules from epidermis cells diffuse into guard cells via osmosis ; guard cell becomes turgid and curves outwards ; stoma opens ; night time : absence of light ; sugar in guard cell coverts into starch ; concentration of sucrose in guard cell becomes low ; water potential in guard cell increase ; water molecules diffuse out from guard cells to epidermis cells via osmosis ; guard cell become sflaccid ; stoma closes
Guard cell work concept = guard cell : only epidermal cell with chloroplasts ; in day, stoma opens so carbon dioxide gas can enter leaf : chloroplast makes sugar(photosyntheisi), guard cell actively pump K+ ions
Differences between leaf cuticle of plant in desert and an aquatic plant = aquatic plant, desert plant
{P} Most aquatic plant do not need cuticle / have thin cuticle as cuticle prevent loss of water ; aquatic plant keep stoma always open : they do not need to retain water ; cuticle is usually thicker : upper surface of leaf
{P} Plants in desert cuticle usually thicker ; cuticle on leaves are usually thicker in dry or windy climate than in wet or calm environment
Effect of water deficiency in plants on stomatal opening and closing = water from plants is lost in form of water vapour to surrounding via stomata ; opening and closing of stoma dependent on turgor pressure of guard cell
{P} fresh plant = plant obtain enough water ; guard cell becomes turgid ; inncer cell wall : thick and less elastic compared to outer wall ; cause guard cells curve outwards and stoma to open
{P} wilted plant = plant lack water ; guard cell flaccid ; outer cell wall become thin and more elastic ; guard cell lose turgidity ; stoma closes
Necessity of Transpiration in plants = transpiration is a process of water loss in form of water vapour through evaporation from plants to atmosphere
Transpiration = a process of water loss in form of water vapour through evaporation from plants to atmosphere ; even though transpiration process takes place through the stem and flowers, 90% water diffuses out through stomata pores in leaves
Transpiration required by plants reason = water absorb heat nenrgy form leaves and evaporates as water vapour to give cooling effect ; produce pulling force that moves water and mineral salts continuously in xylem from roots to all plant cells
Factors affect rate of transpiration = temperature ; humidity ; air movement ; light intensity
{P} Light intensity = higher the light intensity, the higher the rate of respiration ; if light intensity increase, rate of transpiration increases until becomes constant ; contant because relative air humidity, temperature and air movement become the limiting Factors
{P} Relative air humidity = lower relative air humidity of surrounding, faster water vapour escapes from the stomata ; rate of transpiration becomes higher
{P} Temperature = increase in temperature increase kinetic energy of water molecules, thus increasing the rate of respiration
{P} air movement = movement of air carries away water molecules diffused out from leaves ; the faster the air movement, the faster the rate of transpiration
Mud covered leaves affect transpiration = mud sticks to the lower leaf : close the stomatal pore ; reduce the rate of transpiration
Necessity of photosynthesis = plants are autotrophic organisms, produce own food through photosynthesis ; product of photosynthesis : glucose is used by other organisms to generate energy ; energy is needed to carry out living processes such as growth and development
History of photosynthesis = 1640s, Jan-Baptista van Helmont carried out experiment to trst idea of plant obtain their food form soil ; Helmont's conclusion : plant had grown by only being watered and not form water of the soil ; 1722, an experiment conducted by Joseph Priestly showed that plants release oxygen to the atmosphere ; Priestly's conclusion : Plants release oxygen
Photosynthesis = needs chlorophyll to absorb light energy form sun, carbon dioxide form atmosphere and water form soil ; oxygen : by-product ; leaf : main photosynthesis organ, young stem and other green parts of plants also able to carryout photosynthesis
Photosynthesis = photo : light ; synthesis : arranged together or producing
Chlorophyll = [Greek] ; chloras : green ; phyllos : leaf
Chloroplast structure = contain chlorophyll to absorb sunlight and converts to chemical energy ; consists : thylakoids, grana, stroma, lamellae
Thylakoid = disc-shaped sacs containing chlorophyll ; in thylakoid membrane : photosynthetic pigments that trap sunlight ; light-dependent reactions occurs in thylakoid
Granum = disc-shaped stacks of thylakoid ; arrangement increases the surface area for optimal photosynthesis
Stroma = colourless fluid surrounding granum in chloroplast ; site of light-independent reaction to take place : produce glucose
Why leaves change colour? = as summer fades into fall, day start getting shorter and there is less sunlight ; change in length of daylight and temperature causes leaves stop their food making process ; this is a signal for leaf to prepare for winter and stop making chlorophyll ; chlorophyll breakdown : green color dissapears and yellow to orange colors become visible and give leaves part of their fall splendor ; 4 types of pigment in leaf
Pigments in leaf = chloroplast : green ; xanthophylls : yellow ; carotenoids : oranges ; anthocyanins : reds
Chromatography = technique seperating components of mixture based on difference in solubility of the component in certain solvents
Light-dependent reactions = photosynthetic pigments on the surface of the thylakoids absorb light energy ; light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll pigments for higher level ; the excited electrons from the chlorophyll go through a series of electron carriers the energy from the electrons is used to generate energy in the form of ATP ; eventually these electrons are accepted by the last electron acceptor which is the NADP plus ; it then combines with hydrogen ions from photolysis and formed any NADPH which is a reducing agent ; chlorophyll pigment attracts electron from water via photolysis and to become stable ; photolysis is a process whereby water molecules are broken down to form hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in the present on light energy and chlorophyll ; hydroxide ions lose electrons and form oxygen and water
Light-independent reactions = 5-carbon organic compounds fix carbon dioxide gas to form 6-carbon organic compound ; NADPH and  ATP from the light dependant reaction reduced the organic compounds to glucose monomers ; glucose monomers condensed to form starch molecules ; starch granules are stored in the stroma of chloroplast
Calvin cycle = light-independent reaction : 5-carbon organic compounds fix carbon dioxide gas to form 6-carbon organic compound ; NADPH and  ATP from the light dependant reaction reduced the organic compounds to glucose monomers ; glucose monomers condensed to form starch molecules ; starch granules are stored in the stroma of chloroplast
Limiting factor = a factor that controls our biochemistry process and change according to other variables ; increase in the limiting factor will increase the rate of certain biochemistry process if other factors are constant
Environmental factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis = carbon dioxide concentration light intensity temperature
Carbon dioxide concentration = the increase in carbon dioxide concentration increase the photosynthesis rate as long as there are no other limiting factors
Light intensity = light is neither in light dependent reaction ; if concentration of carbon dioxide and temperature are constant rate of photosynthesis  increase until it reached its maximum point at noon[light saturation point] ; after the point the increase in light intensity is no longer increases the rate of photosynthesis because it is limited by other factors
Temperature = the reaction in photosynthesis are catalysed by enzymes ; change of surrounding temperature will affect enzymes activity and also the rate of photosynthesis ; optimum temperature is between 25 - 30 degree celcius ; very high temperature will denatures the enzymes and process of photosynthesis is stopped
Effect of different light intensities and light colours on rate of photosynthesis = rate of photosynthesis in plants is different throughout the day ; rate of photosynthesis is also affected by colour of light ; light spectrum[Violet indigo blue green yellow orange red] : each colour has different wavelengths ; rate of photosynthesis is highest in red and blue light : because red light is absorbed by chlorophyll, blue light is absorbed by carotenoid pigments before transfer to chlorophyll ; these two lights have enough amount of energy to excite electrons in light-dependent reaction
Compensation point = Rate of photosynthesis is the same as the rate of respiration ; No net gain or loss of glucose ; all glucose produced in photosynthesis is used in respiration of plant
Beyond compensation point = rate of photosynthesis becomes faster compared to rate of respiration ; at this time, carbon dioxide needs to be absorbed from atmosphere to compensate the rate of its usage in photosynthesis ; Excessive oxygen is released into the atmosphere ; rate of glucose production exceeds the rate of glucose usage ; assess glucose is stored in the form of starch by plants
Compensation point = rate of photosynthesis must exceed the rate of respiration everyday to ensure the growth and production of flowers seeds and fruits to occur ; enables the rate of glucose production to exceed the rate of glucose usage : assess glucose can be used for growth and development process ; assess oxygen from photosynthesis release into atmosphere to support other organisms
lower compensation point = shade plants tends to have lower compensation points then sun plants ; because they have lower respiration rates and can absorb light more efficiently
shade plants = have thinner leaves which spread : to catch light over a wider area ; I have fewer deep cells : to reduce the respiration rate
