movement of gases between cells = diffusion
vascular plants = plants with a transport system
Non-vascular plants = plants without any transport system ; Exp. : alga, moss
Function of xylem = Transport water and dissolved mineral salts form roots to stem, flower, leaves, fruits ; provide mechanical support
Angiosperm = flowering plants
Gymnosperm = conifers and fern
Function of phloem = transport organic food substances (sucrose and amino acids) ; from leaves both upwards and downwards to various plant part, to the growing regions or storage structures
Movement of water and mineral salts from soil = transpirational pull < capillary action < root pressure
transpirational stream = continuous flow of water through the plant
Transpirational pull = produced when water evaporated from stroma pulls water from the leaves
Capillary action = produced from adhesion force and cohesion force of water molecules which move water upwards the stem against gravity
Root pressure = moves water from soil into xylem vessels of root via osmosis
Water movement form root cells = simplast pathway: water moves through cytoplasm and plasmodesmata ; apoplast pathway: water moves through the spaces between cellulose fibres at the cell wall
Cohesion force = water molecules adhere to one another via hydrogen bonding ; water molecules forms continuous water column in xylem vessels
Adhesive force = water molecules adhere to the xylem walls via hydrogen bonding ; enables water to move up along the narrow xylem vessels
Casparian strips = not permeable to water (waterproof band) ; in the endodermis of root cells ; cause water cannot move through apoplast pathway but through simplast pathway
Guttation = secretion of water droplets through a special structure located at the end of leaf veins without involving stomata ; caused by a high root pressure ; usually occurs at night and early morning (hot and humid condition) (when rate of transpiration is low)
Translocation = process of transporting organic substances such as sucrose, amino acids and hormones in phloem form leaves to other parts of plant, sucha s stem, roots ; 2 directional transport
Traqnspiration = loss of water in water vapour form from a plant to atmosphere ; 90%: via stomata of leaves ; 10%: via cuticle / lenticels
Necessity of translocation in plants = helps in transporting photosynthetic products from leaves to ther parts of plant that needed them for growth and respiration ; exp: roots, fruits, tip of shoot or developing flowers ; also transports excess photosynthetic products to other parts of plant such as rhizomes, tubers, bulbs
Rhizomes = a modified subterranean plant stem that sends out roots and shoots from its nodes ; exp: bamboos, ginger, turmeric
Bulbs = a modified stem that is the resting stage of certain seed plants ; exp: garlic, amaryllis, tulips, daffodils and lilies
Tubers = enlarged structures used as storage organs for nutrients in some plants ; used for plant's perennation(survival of winter / dry months) ;  to provide energy and nutrients for regrowth during the next growing season ; exp: potatoes, jicama, sunchokes, and yams
Phytoremidiation = treatment method which uses aquatic plants that can absorb heavy metals and nutrients contained in waste water for the purpose of degradation, extraction, elimination of pollute substances from soil and water ; Phyton: plant ; remidiate: repair
Phytoextraction = uptake of contaiminants from roots and movement of those contaminants from roots to the above part of plants ; by absorbing, concentrating and precipitating the contaminants
Hyperaccumulator = plants that accumulate particular metals or metalloids in their living tissues to levels higher than normal plants ; sunflower act as a hyperaccumulator: eliminate heavy metals such as zinc, chromium, copper, lead and nickel and also radioactive substances: caesium and strontium
