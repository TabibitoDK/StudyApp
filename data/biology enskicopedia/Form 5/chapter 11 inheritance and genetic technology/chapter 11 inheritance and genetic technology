dimples = indentations on cheek ; a dominent trait ; can be inherited
Chromosome structure = strands of DNA wrap around a protein(histone) forming neucleosomes ; neucleosomes coil together forming chromatin ; loop and coil together forming supercoils ; bunch together forming chromosomes ; DNA strands >> histone >> neucleosomes >> chromatin >> supercoil >> chromosomes
Gene = basic unit of inheritence ; consist of a DNA segment located on specific locus of chromosomes ; a gene control a specific characteristic of organisms
Allele = alternative form of a gene for a specific trait that is located on same locus of pair of homologous chromosomes ; represents a gene is located at the same locus as the gene ; paired chromosomes have same kind of gene, but may have different alleles ; capital letter for dominant ellele, small letter for recessive allele
Monohybrid inheritance = mono[one] ; involves inheritance of one characteristic and contrasting traits controlled by a gene
Genetics = study of inherited characteristics ; first who scientifically explained principle of inheritance is Gregor Mendel[father of modern genetics]
Gregor Mendel = first who scientifically explained principle of inheritance ; father of modern genetics
Father of modern genetics = Gregor Mendel ; first who scientifically explained principle of inheritance
Mendel experiment = figured that pea plants, Pisum sativum possessed 7 different characteristic ; have contrasting traits which are easy to indentify ; suggest that characteristic in a plant is passed down to its next generation through gamates ; this shows nuclei of gamates carry genetic materials of inherited characteristic ; inheritance factor which determine a characteristic is known as gene
Why Mandel choose pea plant? = can be easily grown and bears many seeds ; has both male and female reproductive structure ; has a short generation interval ; possesses contrasting traits or characteristic that are obvious
monohybrid inheritance experiment = used purebreed pea plants[produced through self-cross plant with similar traits to its patental plant] as parental generation ; study the inheritance of plant traits ;
{P} mandel explained trait is determined by a dominant inheritance factor whereas another contrasting trait is determined by a recessive inheritance factor. ; dominant inheritance factor supresses (>) the effect of recessive factor ; therefore, recessive trait is not visible although exist together with dominant trait (Tt)
Characteristic = heritable feature such as eye color, blood group, presence of dimple ; each characteristic is a feuture of an organism
Trait = variation of specific characteristic ; each inherited characteristic consist of a specific trait[exp : hight is a characteristic, tall or dwarf is a trait]
Phenotype  = observable characteristic of organsim ; exp : height, color
Genotype = genetic composition of organism that cannot be seen ; exp : TT and Tt (genotypes for tall), tt (genotypes for dwarf)
Dominant allele = an allele which always show its trait when it is present ; supresses effect of recessive allele ; represented by capital letter ; exp: T
Recessive allele = an allele which shows its trait when both alleles are recessive allele ; suppresed by dominant allele ; represented in small letter ; exp : t
Dominant trait = expressed when both alleles are dominant alleles ; or one dominant allel is paired with recessive allele ; exp : TT or Tt (always dominant first{ Tt correct, tT incorrect})
Recessive trait = expressed if a recessive allele is paired eith another ressesive allele ; exp : tt
Homozygous alleles = both alleles at loci of a pair of homologous chromosomes are same ; exp : TT or tt
Hetrozygous alleles = alleles at loci of a pair of homologous chromosomes are different ; exp : Tt
Purebreed = individuals which carries 2 identical alleles for a trait ; self-cross always produce pure breed with same characteristic ; organism genotype is homozygous
Hybrid = product of mating between 2 purebreed varieties ; 2 different alleles for a trait
Parental generation = first generation of 2 individuals which are mated to predict or analyse genotypes of their offspring
Filial generation = sucessive generation as result of mating between individuals of purebreed parental generation ; first filial generation (F1), second filial generation (F2),......
Mandel's first law = Law of Segregation ; " a characteristic of an organism is controlled by a pair of alleles, and only one allelic pair is inherited in a gamate ; during meiosis, alleles segregate, homologous chromosomes seperate ; each allele for a trait is packaged into a seperate gamate [(Pp) >> (P) and (p)]
Law of Segregation = Mandel's first law ; " a characteristic of an organism is controlled by a pair of alleles, and only one allelic pair is inherited in a gamate ; during meiosis, alleles segregate, homologous chromosomes seperate ; each allele for a trait is packaged into a seperate gamate [(Pp) >> (P) and (p)]
Dihybrid inheritance = involves inheritance of 2 characteristics [exp : BBKK or BbKk], each characteristic is controlled by different gene located at differet locus
Mendel's second law = Law of Independent Assortment ; " During gamate formation, each allele form a pair of alleles can combine freely with any allele form another pair of allele " ; 2 characteristic (seed shape and colour) are combined in F1 generation, but later seperate and react freely in F2 generation
locus = specific location of a gene in a chromosome
huamn chromosomes = 2 types : autosomes[44 in human / pairs 1-22] and sex chromosomes[2 in human / pair 23] ; autosomes vary in terms of size and length
Autosomes = chromosomal pairs 1-22 ; controls all characteristics of somatic cells ; exp : type of blood group, skin colour, height
Sex chromosomes = chromosomal pair 23 ; consist genes which determine gender ; male : XY, female : XX
karyotype = number and structure of chromosomes present in a cell nucleus ; chromosomes are arranged in pairs, in term of their size, centromere location, banding pattern ; exp : malr karyotypre (44 + XY), female karyotype (44 + XX)
