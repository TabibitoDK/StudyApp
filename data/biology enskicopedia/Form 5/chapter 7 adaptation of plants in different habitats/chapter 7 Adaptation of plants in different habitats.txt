Adaptation = adjustment of an organism to the environment
Plants adaptation = observed in the shape of its leaves, roots, stem to adjust itself to live in its habitat
Plants habitat = mesophytes[habitat not too dry or too wet] ; hydrophytes[aquatic habitats], halophytes[swampy habitats], xerophytes[hot and dry with minimum water]
Halophytes = plants live in swampy habitats at river mouth ; meeting point of fresh water and seawater ; water rich in salt content ; exp. : mangrove tree
Hydrophytes = Plants live in aquatic habitats, either on water surface or submerged ; exp. : Lotus and Elodea sp.
Mesophytes = plants live in habitat not too wet or too dry ; with an adequate supply of water ; most plants are mesophytes ; exp. : mango tree, hibiscus plant, rubber tree
Xerophytes = plants live in hot and dry weather habitat ; with minimum presence of water ; very high temperature ; exp. : cactus, date plalm
Adaptive features of halophytes = plants that can live in a habitat with high concentration of salt and low oxygen content ; also exposed to high intensity of light
{P} leaves = thick cuticle, sunken stoma : reduce rate of transpiration ; succulent leaves : store water ; hydathode structure : eliminate excessive salt ; old leaves store salt and fall off when the concentration of salt is too high
{P} roots = provide support for plant to continue live in the softy and muddy soil ; prevents plants from being purooted due to strong wind ; breathing roots : grow vertically upwards above the surface of soil, called pneumatophores ; lenticels : enable the exchange of gases with the atmosphere ; cell sap of roots does not lose water ny osmosis ; receive water and mineral from seawater
Pneumatophores = aerial root specialized for gaseous exchange
Lenticels = one of many raised pores in the stem of a woody plant that allows gas exchange between the atmosphere and the internal tissues
Adaptive features of hydrophytes = plant that can adapt their wet habitat
{P} fibrous roots = provide large surface area and trap air bubbles to enable hydrophates to be more stable and lighter ; enable then to float or stay upright in the water as well as buoyant force exerted by the surrounding water
{P} Floating plants = Lotus ; floating plant[not anchored to bottom of lake] ; leaves - broad, thin, flat : abosrb maximun sunlight for photosynthesis ; stomata : distributed on upper epidermis of leaves, covered by waxy, waterproof cuticle to ensure stomata always open
{P} stem = consist aerenchyma tissues[light tissue with plenty of air spaces between cell]
{P} Submerged plant = Elodea sp. ; grow completely inside water ; leaves : thin and small to increase TSA/V ratio and to increase diffusion rate of water, mineral gasses and dissolved gas directly into plants through epidermis ; no stomata and waxy cuticle on leaves ; stems : small and hollow - float upright - reduce water flow resistance
Aerenchyma tissues = tissue having cell with large intercellular air spaces involved in the exchange of gases in plants ; present in hydrophates
Adaptive features of xerophytes = xerophytes live in desert ; receive little rainfall ;
{P} roots = grow widely and can penentrate deep into soil to absorb water and mineral salts ; absorbed water is stored in the roots, stems and leaves
{P} stem = carries out photosynthesis
{P} leaves = small leaves ; thick waxy cuticles on leave and stem ; also leaves modified into thorns to reduce TSA exposed to sun >> reduce water loss
{P} thorns = help to get water supply by collecting dew ; dew will drop on ground and absorbed by roots ; thorn also prevent plant form eaten by animals
{P} stomata = embedded to reduce water evaporation from leaves
Embedded stomata = sunken stomata
Sunken stomata = stomata which are not directly exposed to surface ; it is in a small pit, which protects the escaping water vapour from air currents, decreasing water loss from the leaf
