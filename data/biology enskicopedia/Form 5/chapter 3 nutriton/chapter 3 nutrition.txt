Compost = type of fertiliser produced from decomposition process of left over substance ; such as crop leftovers, kitchen leftovers, plants excretory substance and animal faeces ; which are the composed by microorganisms
How organic compost fertiliser made = left over substance together with bacteria placed in a container with aeration to speed up the decomposition process ; dry left over substance are layered with wet left over substance alternately ; water is sprinkled on every layer ; left over substance are served every two days until compose is formed ; compost is usually done after being kept for a few months ; practise of producing compost fertiliser at home can save many landfill sites ; the cost of buying chemical fertilisers can also be reduced
Inorganic nutrients for plants = plants need inorganic nutrients to produce organic compounds such as carbohydrates and protein ; these nutrients can be divided according to quantities required by plants[macronutrients and micro nutrients]
Macronutrients = carbon hydrogen and oxygen ; obtain easily from air and water from the soil ; make up most of the dry mass of plants ; lack of these nutrients is rarely experienced by plants
necessity of macronutrients in plants = complete their life cycle ; achieve optimum growth and development ; lack of one or more micro nutrients can cause bad effects on health and growth of plant
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen in plants = important component in carbon cycle and oxygen cycle ; components in all organic compounds of plant ; important component in synthesis of sugar ; effect of deficiency : photosynthesis will not take place, less oxygen released, stunted growth which can cause death because no glucose
nitrogen in plants = give the green colour to plants through formation of chlorophyll ; main component of proteins nucleic acid and enzymes in photosynthesis and respiration ; effect of deficiency : leaves undergo chlorosis(mainly on matured leaves), underlying leaves fall off, protein synthesis disrupted, stunted growth
potassium in plants = important in protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism ; as cofactors for some enzymes ; maintain plan turgidity ; effect of deficiency : protein synthesis disrupted, edges of leaves become yellowish, premature death of plants
calcium in plants = main component of middle lamella cell wall and spindle fibres during cell division ; effect of deficiency : parts between mature leaf veins become yellowish, red spots on leaf surface, lobed leaves
magnesium in plants = synthesis nuclear acids and ATPs and phospholipids in plasma membrane ; act as coenzymes in photosynthesis and respiration ; effect of deficiency : unhealthy root growth, formation of the green and dull coloured leaf, red or purple spots appear on older leaves
sulphur in plants = components of a few amino acids ; one of vitamin B constituent and a few types of coenzymes ; effect of deficiency : leaves or the whole plant turns yellow

Culture solution = solution used to study the importance of nutrients for plant growth ; known as knop's solution
Knop's solution = solution containing all the nutrients including trace elements needed by healthy plant
Root collar = part of the root connected to the base of plant stem
Root hairs = adapted from epidermal cells of root ; increase total surface area of roots to increase uptake of water and mineral salts
Root cap = located at the tip of the root ; protect root from damage when going through soil
Epidermis[roots] = epidermis cells are closely arranged ; thin cell wall and water permeable cell membrane facilitate movement of roots ; have epidermal cell which form root hairs by elongating towards lateral sides from outer wall ; root hair cells not layered with cuticle : allow water absorbtion ; root hair cells have big vacuole to store water and mineral salts, increase water absorbtion
Cortex[roots] = located under epidermal layer ; has thin cell walls, facilitating water movement in roots ; cells are loosely arranged to facilitate gaseous exchange ; most cortex consists of parenchyma cells
Endodermis[roots] = seperating between cortex and vascular cylinder ; cells are cloosely arranged and one cell thick ; most endodermal cells have suberin or lignin thickening at walls[casperian strips] ; endodermis allows water and mineral salts absorbed form soil to enter vascular cylinder, not air bubbles
Vascular cylinder[roots] = root core that consist xylem and phloem ; pericycle is involved in secondary grwth and formation of lateral roots ; usially in roots, xylen and phloem are arranged in a star-shaped pattern
Main fuction of roots = provide support and strength to anchor plant in soil ; absorb water and mineral salts form soil and transport them to stem and leaves
Uptake of water in soil = 1. water form soil absorbed into root hair cell ; 2. -- across cortex cells -- ; 3. -- across phloem -- into xylem vessels ; 4. -- up xylem vessels to plant
Nutrition = process of organisms obtaining energy and nutrients from food ; for growth, maintenence and repair of damaged tissues ; parasitic, epiphytic, carnivorous plants have different adaption to obtain energy
{Nutrition} Parasitic plants = live by growing on other plants which are the host ; root of plant absorb organic substances, minerals and water form host by penetrating the stem up to the vascular bundle of host ; causes parasitic plants to grow faster and fluorish, whereas host is malnourished, dried and eventually die ; exp. Rafflesia parasite, vampire parasite, root parasite, Lophophytum mirabile, Balanophoraceae
{NUtrition} Epiphytic plants = green plants which live on other plants which are host ; receive more sunlight for photosynthesis by living on taller host ; synthesis their own food ; do not harm host because roots of epiphytes can absorb nutrients accumulated in gaps of plant's stem ; most have swollen stems that are able to store lots of water
{Nutrition} Carnivorous plants = able to synthesise their own food by carrying out photosynthesis ; secrete nectar and have cups to trap prey (typically insects) ; prey slowly digested by digestive enxymes ; trapped animals can supply nitrogen to plants ; because carnivorous plants live in soil lact of nitrogen sources ; nitrogen is important for growth
Hydrothermal vent = a fissure on the seafloor from which geothermally heated water discharges ; commonly found near vocanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart and spreading centers, ocean basins, and hotspots
