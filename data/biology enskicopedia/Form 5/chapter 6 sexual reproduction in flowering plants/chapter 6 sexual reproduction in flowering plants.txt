Flowers = most distinctive organs in angiosperms ; play a role in ensuring survivial of species ; contain plant reproductive structure ; contain both male and female reproductive organs[male:Stamens,female:Carpels] ; contain structure : peduncles, sepals, petals
Male reproductive organ[flower] = Stamens ; Contain Anther and Filament
Filament = a long stalk which support anther
Anther = structure that produce pollen grains ; pollen grains contain male gamates
Female reproductive organ[flower] = Carpel ; Contain Stigma, Style, Ovary, Ovule ; pistil : stigma, style, ovary
Pistil = stigma, style, ovary
Stigma = sticky structure at apex of style to which pollen grains adhere
Style = a stalk that joins stigma to ovary
Ovary = structure that contain ovule ; may have one or more ovules form which the female gametes develop
Angiosperms = plants that produce flowers and bear their seeds in fruits
Gymnosperms =  plants that do not flower and bear "naked seeds."[seeds are produced on the surface of the reproductive structure, rather than enclosed within it as in a fruit]
Hermaphrodites = bisexual flower ; both male and female reproductive organs are within same flower
Monoecious = refers to the plants having both male and female flowers in the same plant but not necessarily on the same flower
Dioecious = having the male and female reproductive organs on separate plants (of the same species) rather than different parts of the same plant
Development of pollen grain = during development of anther, group of tissue grow inside each lobe to form 4 pollen sac ; each pollen sac contain hundreds of pollen mother cells called microspore mother cells which are diploid ; microspore mother cells divides by meiosis to form four haploid microspore cells collectively known as tetrad ; each cell in tetrad develops into pollen grain ; nucleus in pollen grain divides by mitosis and form 2 nuclei, generative nucleus and tube nucleus ; wall of pollen sac, which is thick and waterproof breaks when pollen grain matures ; pollen grains are released ; gymnosperm phylum plants such as pines and fir do not have flowers, however they produce pollen throuch structures called cones[pollen cone:male, seed cone:female] ; seed cone larger than pollen cone
Formation of embryo sac in ovule = 
Ovule = structures of flower formed inside carpel ; develop from a layer of tissues inside ovary ; single ovary may contain one or more ovules ; ovule attatches to ovary through funicle ; area of attatchment of funicle to ovary is called placenta
funicle = stalk which attatch ovule to ovary wall
placenta = area of attatchment of funicle to the ovary ; supplies nutrients to ovule through funicle
nucellus = a mass of tissue inside ovary develops forming a lump called nucellus ; consists of parenchyma tissue ; nucellus develops into tow layers called integument ; one of the nucellus cells is the megaspore mother cell / embryo sac mother cell which will develop to form an embryo sac
integument = nucellus tissue develops into 2 layers called integument
micropyle = a little opening at the end of integument which allows the entry of air and water into the seed during germination
Formation of embryo sac in ovule = 1. The ovule develops from the ovarian tissue. Ithas a diploid embryo sac mother cell (2n). Each ovule consists of protective outer layersof cells called the integuments. ; 2. The embryo sac mother cell (2n) undergoes meiosis to form a row of four haploid cells called megaspores (n) ; 3. Three of the four megaspores degenerate, leaving one in the ovule ; 4. The megaspore continues to grow and enlarges, filling up most of the ovule. The nucleus of the megaspores then undergoes mitosis three times to form eight haploid nuclei ; 5. Three of the eight nuclei migrate to one end of the cell to form antipodal cells ; Another two nuclei, called the polar nuclei, move to the centre ; One of the three nuclei nearest the opening of the ovule (micropyle) develops into an egg cell or female gamete, flanked by two synergid cells ; The structure formed is known as the embryo sac. It is where the embryo will develop ; The ovule, which eventually becomes a seed, now consists of the embryo sac and the surrounding integuments ; The eight cells formed in the embryo sac no cell walls ; The synergid cells are believed to provide nutrition and support to the egg cell ; The integuments form protective layers around the embryo sac
......
Pollination = process which pollen grains form the anther are transferred to the stigma of a flower ; assisted by pollination agents such as insects, mammals, birds, water and wind ; presence of pollen grains on stigma triggers process of fertilisation ; secretion of sugar solution in stigma stimulates the pollen grain to germinate and form pollen tube
Fertilisation = trigerred by presence of pollen grains on the stigma
DOuble fertilisaiton = process unique to angiosperms ; occurs within the ovule ; involves two male gametes, in which the first male gamete fertilises the egg cell to form a diploid zygote whereas the second male gamete fuses with polar nuclei to form a triploid endosperm tissue
Importance of double fertilisation for the survival of flowering plants = formation of zygote ensures the genetic information of parent plants is passed down to next generation ; endosperm provides food for developing embryo during germination, this guarenteees a seed will germinate sucessfully into a new plant ;
