habitat = natural surrounding or living place of an organism
species = group of similar organisms, able to interbreed and produce offsprings
population = group of organisms of same species, which live in same habitat
community = the populations of all organisms from different species living in the same habitat while interacting with each other
ecosystem = communities that live together in a habitat and interact iwth each another ; including non-living component(abiotic), such as water, air, soil
niche = role of an organism in an ecosystem ; includes its behavior and interactions with biotic and abiotic components in the surrounding of its habitat ; niche of organism can vary according to morphological change of an organism ; no species can share the same niche based on the competitive exclusion principle
morphological change = changes to the outward appearance as well as the form and structure of internal parts, like bones and organs
ecological niche = role of species in its surrounding
species niche = way in which a species interact with biotic and abiotic components within its surrounding
competitive exclusion principle = no species can share the same niche
biotic component = all organisms in an ecosystem which interact with other organism include : producer, consumer, decomposer
abiotic component = all non-living elements including their physical and chemical characteristics that can affect an organism in an ecosystem ; include : pH value, temperature, light intensity, topography, microclimate, air humidity
{abiotic component} pH value = pH value of soil strongly influence distribution of living organisms in habitat ; soil is habitat to millions of worms and microorganisms ; most organisms are capable living in condition of neutral or almost neutral pH value
{abiotic component} temperature = surrounding temperature affect physiological activitties of organisms ; little change in temp cause a reduction in metabolic rate of organisms as all enzymes that catalyst physiological response of body are sensitive towards temp change ; most organisms can live within range 20 - 40 degree celcius ; there are also some organisms which can live in extreme temp [polar bear(-14 °C) foxes(45 °C)]
{abiotic component} light intensity = light intensity and duration of sunlight received strongly influence distribution of organism especially for plants due to rate of photosynthesis ; tropical rainforest : tallest plant exposed to high light intensity, small plant grow under canopy ; coniferous forest in region of temperate climate : low density of plants due to low light intensity, they grow shorter and smaller too
{abiotic component} topography = ...... to be added ............
{abiotic component} microclimate = refer to climate condition of small area which is different from surrounding area ; can take place under rocks or beneath shades of bigger plants ; microclimate depends on temp, humidity, light intensity, heat balance, pressure, water evaporation and ability of soil to retain water to maintain humidiy
{abiotic component} air humidity = is the quantity of water vapour in air which affect the distribution of organism ; high humidiy area : more organism occupying ; low air humidity increase water loss through stoma by transpiration, enhance absorbtion of water and mineral salts from soil ; transpiration provide cooling effect, maintain optimum temp for enzyme activity
nutrition = way for organism to obtain nutrients and energy from the food for its life processes ; two types : autotrophic and hetotrophic
Photoautotrophic = organism that synthesises complex organic compound from carbon dioxide with light energy ; synthesise own food via photosynthesis
CHemoautotrophic = a few type of bacteria which synthesise organic compound without using light ; gain energy from oxidation of inorganic substances such as hydrogen sulphide and ammonia through chemosynthesis
Saprotrophic = saprophytic organisms which gain their nutrients from dead and decaying organic substances ; digestion occurs outside of body of organism before nutrients are absorbed into body
Holozoic = organism that survives by eating solid organic substances which are then digested and absorbed into body ; most animal and humans are Holozoic
Parasitic = organism that absorb nutirents form host ; exp : fleas and tapewoirm that get nutrients form human host
Autotroph = auto[self]troph[eater]
Heterotroph = Heteros[others]troph[eater]
Biotic component = organisms that need energy to carry out life processes ; humans and animals gain energy by feeding on other organisms including photosynthetic plants ; main source energy for all organism : sun
trophic level = position of organisms which can be llinked by the energy flow in food Chain
Decomposers = microorganisms that decompose waste substances as well as dead or decaying organisms into simpler organic substances such as carbon dioxide and ammonia
Producers = autotrophs which synthesise organic substances from inorganic substances ; consist of green plant which synthesise glucose form water and carbon dioxide
Primary consumer = herbivores - gain energy by feeding producer
Secondary consumers = Carnivores - feed on primary consumers or carnivores which feed on primay consumers and producers
Tertiary consumers = carnivores which feed on secondary consumers
Energy flow i food chain = organisms in ecosystem interact with each another, forming a feeding relationship - can be shown in food chain
food chain = sequence of energy transfer from one trophic level to another trophic level, beginning with producers
food web = shows the feeding realtionship in a community ; consist several food chains ; organism in all food chain rely on each other in feeding aspects
ecological pyramid = describe factors that changes each trophic level ; consist of : pyramid of numbers[number of organisms at every trophic level], pyramid of biomass[total biomass per unit area], pyramid of energy[demonstrate total energy present in an ecosystem] ; pyramid of number and biomass can exist inverted in certain circumstances
type of interactions among biotic components = symbiosis, predation, competition
2 type of competition = intraspecific competition[among organisms of same species] and interpecific competition[among prganisms of different species]
interpecific competition = among prganisms of different species
intraspecific competition = among organisms of same species
saprophytism = interaction in which an organism gets its food from dead organic materials
predation = interaction involving 2 organisms, a prey and a predator
competition = occurs to organisms in a habitat to compete in order to get basic needs[water, food, mate for breeding]
symbiosis = occurs when different species that live together interact with each another
mutualism = benifits both organism ; exp : buffalo and myna
commensalism = benifit for only one organism, but no harm to another ; exp : shark and remora fish
parasitism = benifits one organism, harm the other ; tapewarm inside huamn body intestine absorbing nutrients
Mangrove ecosystem = mangroves tree are tropical plants, ususally found in estuaries[place sea and river meet] ; they succesful adapted to the extreme abiotic components ; Other Biotic components : other flora and fauna, decomposers
Adaptation features of mangrove tree = leaves : thick cuticle, sunken stomata[reduce rate of transparent], succulent leaves[store water], hydathode[special structure eliminate excess salt], mature leaves store salt[will fall when concentration of salt too high] ; Pneumatophore roots : shoot root projections from soil surface for aeration, alow gaseous exchange between submerged root and atmosphere through lenticels ; Prop roots : prop roots branch out from lower part of stem of mangrove tree, firmly planted in soil to support tree overcome strong winds, waves ; Buttress roots : types of roots with thick structure that can add in widening the base of tree, roots provide support to tree that grows on soft soil[border with solid land] ; seeds : viviparous seeds germinate and grow when they are still on parent plant[enables fallen seedlings stick inot muddy soil and will not be uprooted by waves]
colonisation = plants start to conquer an uninhabited area, breed and form colonies in that area
sucession = few species of dominent plants in a habitat are gradually being replaced by other species called sucessor
coastal zone = area most exposed to big waves ; dominated by pioneer species[Avicennia sp. and sonneratia sp.] ; enlarged root system and pneumatophores helps tree to trap mud and organic substances brought by high tides ; mud accumulation slowly begins and soil become higher and denser ; Rhizophora sp. suceeds and replace pioneer species
middle zone = situated along the river, closer to estuaries ; inhabitated by Rhizophora sp. plants that have tangled prop roots ; roots can trap twigs and mud which are washed away and blocked flow of river ; trapped mud cause sedimentation occurs much faster ; river bank become higher and drier as less seawater overflows during high tides ; soil become less suitable for growth of Rhizophora sp. and more suitable for Bruguiera sp. which suceed and replace Rhizophora sp.
inland zone = situated further into land ; soil become higher, harder and olny flows with seawater during high tides ; inhabited by Bruguiera sp. which have buttress roots to rap more mud and silt ; sedimentation proces form new swamp that projects out towards sea ; the one-time-shore gets further away form sea and ground changes into land suitable for land trees such aas Pandanus sp., Nypa fruticans which suceed and replace Bruguiera sp.
importance of mangrove ecosystem = protection zone ; fishery resources ; forestry resources ; food and medicine resources
population ecology = branch of ecology - studies interactions of a population with its surrounding
population distributuion = shows how organisms of same species able to spread out in habitat
factors affecting population distribution = Plant : ; temperature ; water ; light ; pH of soil ; mineral salt content Animals : ; temperature ; water ; breeding site ; food supply
patterns of population distribution = clumped ; random ; uniform
population size = numbers of organisms present in a population ; can be estimated by random sampling technique[when studied area is large and difficult to obtain data]
population density = number of individuals of a species per unit area of a habitat
Quadrat sampling technique = can estimate population size of land animals or plants which are inactive or move slowly
{quadrat sampling technique} frequency = probability to get an individual of any plant species in every quadrat
{quadrat sampling technique} density = average number of individuals in any species per unit area of study
{quadrat sampling technique} coverage percentage = percentage of soil surface covered by plants
Traditional plant sampling method = plot-less methods, distance methods, quadrat sampling ; can provide accurate estimates of cover, density, frequency
Capture-Mark-release-recapture technique = can estimate the population size of organisms which can move freely in the studied area
