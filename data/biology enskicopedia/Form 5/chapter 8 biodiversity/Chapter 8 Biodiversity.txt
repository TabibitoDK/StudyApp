Biodiversity = variety of living organisms such as microorganisms, animals that interact with each other
Taxanomy = field in biology which involves the classification, identification and naming of organisms in an organised manner ; to manage information and data collected using a systematic and methodic approach to elucidate the scientific community
Taxonomic classification system = 3 parts : ; classification - taxanomy heirarchy system ; identification - dichotomous key ; naming - binomial nomenclature system
Texanomic heirarchy system = kingdom ; phylum ; class ; order ; family ; genus ; species
Binomial nomenclature = bi[two]nomial[name] nomenclature[system of naming] ; first letter - Genus (first letter capitalised) ; second letter - species ; either underline or italicize ; written in latin
Importance of classification and naming of organisms = all organisms needed to be classified based on defining features in a systematic manner, ; in order to facilitate studies and discussions among scientist in an international level
classification of organisms = all organisms in world are categorised into 6 kingdoms : ; Archeabacteria, Eubacteria, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, Animalia ; classified based on : ; types of cell, number of cells, type of nutrition
Prokaryote = a type of cell which lacks a membrane-bound nucleus and membrane enclosed organelles
Eukaryote = has nucleus and membrane enclosed organelles
Unicellular = single-celled
Multicellular = more than one cell ; multi-celled
Heterotroph = an organism that cannot synthesise its own food but obtains food moleules by eating other organisms
Autotroph = an organism that can systhesis its own food from organic materials by using light energy[photosynthesis] or chemical energy[chemosynthesis]
Archeabacteria = prokaryote ; unicellular ; primitive bacteria ; hass cell wall with no peptidoglycan ; non pathogenic ; lives in very hot, acidic, salty, anaerobic environments ; example : SUlfolobus sp.[sulphur oxidising bacteria], Holobacterium salinarum
Methanogen = obligate anaerobic bacteria[micororganisms killed by normal atmospheric concentrations of oxygen] ; found in swamps and digestive tract ; produces methane as a metabolic byproduct
Obligate anaerobes = micororganisms killed by normal atmospheric concentrations of oxygen
obligate anaerobic = micororganisms killed by normal atmospheric concentrations of oxygen
Halophile = found in places with extremely high salt concentration ; such as the Dead Sea
Thermophile = bacteria that can withstand high temperatures and [develop in a healthy or vigorous way] at an optimum temperature of 60 - 80 degree celcius ; found in hot springs highly acidic locations such as the Yellowstone National Park in U.S.
Methanogen = microorganisms that produce methane as a metabolic by-product in hypoxic (oxygen depletion) conditions
Obligate anaerobes = Clostridium botulinum[ anaerobic, rod-shaped sporeforming bacterium] and the bacteria which live near hydrothermal vents on the deep-sea ocean floor
Aerotolerant organisms = organisms which cannot use oxygen for growth, but tolerant its presence ; faculative anaerobes, which can grow without oxygen but use oxygen if its present
Faculative anaerobes = organisms which can grow without oxygen but use oxygen if its present ; bacteria that can grow in both the presence or absence of oxygen
Eubacteria = prokaryote ; unicellular ; also known as "ture bacteria" ; cell wall made up of peptidoglycan ; cytoplasm of eubacteria contains ribosome and plasmid but has none of the membrane-enclosed organelles ; classified according to their shape : cocci[spheres], bacilli[rods], spiral
Peptidoglycan = also known as murein which is a polymer made up of sugars and amino acids
Membrane-enclosed organelles = endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, endosomes
Plasmid = small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule distinc from a cell's chromosomal DNA ; naturally exist in bacterial cells ; also occur in some eukaryote cells ; gene carried in plasmids often provide genetic advantages (such as antibiotic resistance)
Cyanobacteria = blue-green algae ; contains chloroplast and can undergo photosynthesis
Protista = eukaryote ; Multicellular ; can be either Heterotroph or autotroph or both ; has simple cell organisation without specialised tissue ; contain membrane-bound nucleus and membrane enclosed organelles
Protista = divided into 3 groups : protozoa, algea, slime mould
Protozoa = single-celled eukaryotes ; exp. : Euglena sp., Amoeba sp., Paramecium sp.
Algea = predominantly aquatic, photosynthetic, and nucleus-bearing organisms ; photosynthesize but lack the specialized multicellular reproductive structures of plants ; exp. : Chlaydomonas sp., Spirogyra sp.
Slime mould = unrelated eukaryotic organisms that can live freely as single cells, but can aggregate together to form multicellular reproductive structures ; exp. physarum polycephalum
Fungi = eukaryote ; unicellular or multicellular ; Heterotrophs(saprophytes or parasites) ; cell wall made up of chitin ; body made up of a thread-like network of hyphae called mycelium ; exp. Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast), Agricus sp.(mushroom)
Chitin = Much like cellulose in plants, the chitin is deposited extracellularly with proteins and other molecules ; This forms a rigid cell wall between cells, which help the organisms retain their shape
Mycelium = a network of fungal threads or hyphae
Hyphae = a long, branching filamentous structure of a fungus ; are collectively called a mycelium ; main mode of vegetative growth in Fungi
Plantea = eukaryote ; include all multicellular plants ; can synthesise own food via photosynthesis[bcs have chloroplast] ; can undergo sexual / asexual reproduction ; exp. seedless plants[fern], plants with seed[all flowering plants]
Nonvascular plant = do not have a well-developed system for transporting water and food[no true roots, stems, leaves] ; get nutrients directly from environment and pass them cell by cell ; plants very small size ; exp. : mosses, liverworts, hornworts
Vascular plant = 
Animalia = eukaryote ; involves all multicellular animals ; heterotrophs ; most animals can move and reproduce sexually ; exp. : invertebrate(starfish), vertebrate(elephant)
Taxonomy Heirarchy =  system used in taxanomy is : Linnaeus heirarchy system ; classifies organisms according to hierarchy : domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species
Dichotomous key = tool used by taxanomist to indentify organisms based on similarities and difference ; one way to build is by using a series of couplets ; dichotomous key is specific to an identification process ; when identifying different organism, a different set of dichotomous key is used ; traits choosen must be based on observable features ; overlapping traits must be avoided
cuoplets = made up of 2 statements about the organism's traits or it's grouping
traits = a distinguishing quality or characteristic ; a genetically determined characteristic
Carolus Linnaeus = Person who introduced the binomial nomenclature system
Genetic diversity = gene variation of an individual within a population ; and ; gene variation between different populations of the same species ; difference in gene is due to individual isolation or adaptation to different environments ; no 2 individual of same species are identical ; exp. : there are many varieties of cultivated rice all over the world
Species diversity = variation and variability of organisms on Earth ; includes the total number of species in a community[species richness] and the species distribution in a community[species evenness] ; exp. : There are 5-10 million of insects species
Ecosystem diversity = biotic community and ecological process in ecosystems on the land, in the sea and other aquatic environment ; exp. : There are ecosystems rich with biodiversity that can be found in the ocean
Phylogeny = the evolutionary history of a species or a group of prganisms that are genetically linked
Phylogenic tree = a diagram that repersents hypothesis on evolutionary relationship amoung a group of organisms
Phylogenetic classification = classification system that shows the evoluntary erlationship and history of the studied organisms ; classification is done using homologous structure
Homologous structure = structure(body parts or body anatomy) that can be observed across multiple organisms which share the same ancestor even though of structure may differ from an organism to another
In situ conservation = maintains species in their natural habitat such as : ; in the National Park ; permanent forest reserves
Ex situ conservation = efforts to conserve species found outside of their natural habitats such as : ; in zoos ; botanical gardens
Importance of biodiversity on environment and humans = Every individual, organisations and the government must play their roles in preserving and conserving biodiversity ; Biodiversity also maintains a balance in nature, for both recreation and scientific research.
Role in preserving and conserving biodiversity = making structured and sustainable development plans so that forests are not cut down and deforestation does not occur ; avoid products made from animal hide or body parts that are thought to have medicinal value.
Importance of biodiversity towards humans = As a source of research and development : A sanctuary for wildlife and endemic life ; maintain environmental temperature ; provide food to humans and animals ; provide raw materials and medicinal products to humans ; generate income for the population and the country
Bacteria = do not have nucleus due to the lack of nuclear membrane ; genetic material exist in the form of chromosomal threads(DNA) free floating in the cytoplasm[known as nucleoid] ; some bacteria have plasmid[a small DNA molecule that carry extr genes] ; size range from 1 to 10 um ; can exist as a single cell, a diploid(a pair), IN A FILAMENT, CHAINS OR CLUSTERS ; can exist in : bacillus(rod/cylinder), cuccus(sphere), vibro(comma), spirillum(spiral) ; exp. : Lactobacillus sp., Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus
Lactobacillus sp. = facultatively anaerobic, catalase-negative, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming rods that often grow better under microaerophilic conditions ; found in a wide variety of environments, including soil, plants (particularly decaying plant material) and animals (especially the oral cavity, intestinal tract and vagina).
Streptococcus sp. = Streptococcus is a genus of gram-positive coccus ; Strep throat is caused by infection with a bacterium known as Streptococcus pyogenes
Staphylococcus aureus = Gram-positive round-shaped bacterium, a member of the Firmicutes, and is a usual member of the microbiota of the body, frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin.
Gram-positive bacteria = bacteria that give a positive result in the Gram stain test ; Bacteria with thick peptidoglycan ; no outer lipid membrane
Gram-positive bacteria = bacteria that do not retain the crystal violet stain used in the Gram staining method of bacterial differentiation ; have a thin peptidoglycan layer ; have an outer lipid membrane
Protozoa = unicellular ; move around with pseudopodium[false feet] ; cilia ; flagellum ; usually found in aquatic habitats ; Heterotroph or autotroph ; can be free living or parasitic

Tobacco virus = a widespread plant pathogen ; do not cause infection to human and mammals
HIV virus = virus that attacks the body's immune system ; If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) ; currently no effective cure ; But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled
AIDS = chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ; By damaging immune system, HIV interferes with body's ability to fight infection and disease
Types of virus = helical[Tobacco Mosaic Virus], polyhedral[Adenovirus], spherical[Influenza virus], complex[Bacteriophage]
